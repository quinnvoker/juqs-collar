# JUQS Collars for Sanjuks V6

A personal project to develop additional collar types and "gate" shapes for Sanjuks V6 levers. I devoted most of my time towards fine-tuning the "OCTN" model (nobi pro-like shape), but there are several other shapes available.

I'm pretty happy with the results, but don't wish to pursue production myself, so I've made this repo open source. 

Some pre-rendered OCTN collars are included in the `renders` folder. You can render collars with different shapes and profiles using the source files and OpenScad.

I have no plans to develop this further and will not provide support. I've done a little bit of explaining in comments, but for the most part you'll just have to hop into OpenScad and mess around with `juqs_collar.scad` if you want to play around with it. Good luck! This was my first-ever OpenScad project so be prepared to find a mess if you go digging.
